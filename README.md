## Description

My motivation for making this project was to make a porject using sequelize. I built this project to show that I know how to use mysql databases and sequelize together. This application solves the problem of having to keep track of a large number of items in stock. I learned from making this project was how to use javascript and sequelize to create and read data from a database.
